# Car Parking Lot Problem v2
 
<p> The goal of this problem is to demonstrate some of the algorithms we studied in course CS340 (Artificial Intelligence). The notebook will cover the car parking lot problem in detail, explaining how the algorithms work and how well they perform, as well as comparing their performance relative to each other by highlighting visible differences and the time it takes them to solve the problem, and finally concluding with which algorithm provided the most optimal solution. </p>
